            <h2>Facts About Dogs</h2>
            <p>
                Dogs have a sense of time. It's been proven that they know the difference between
                a hour and five. If conditioned to, they can predict future events, such as regular walk
                times.

                A study was conducted on dogs being away from their owners for varying hours,
                and the studies show that dogs who were away from their owners the longest showed the
                greatest amount of affection!
